Different scopes, such as the 2x, 4x, and 8x, require distinct sensitivity adjustments to maintain precision across varying magnifications. Lower sensitivity values for scoped aiming can stabilize your crosshair, facilitating precise long-range shots with minimal sway. Conversely, higher sensitivity settings enable swift adjustments when scanning the battlefield or engaging targets at different distances. Experimentation with scoped sensitivity is crucial for finding the balance between control and responsiveness, ensuring consistent performance in intense firefights.",

Begin by adjusting your sensitivity settings specifically for scoped aiming, tailoring them to match your preferred magnification levels and playstyle. Lower sensitivity values provide finer control over crosshair movements, allowing for steady tracking of distant targets and precise adjustments for headshots. In contrast, higher sensitivity settings offer quicker responsiveness, enabling rapid target acquisition and fluid aiming transitions between multiple adversaries. Regularly reassess and refine scoped sensitivity parameters to adapt to different scopes and enhance your effectiveness in long-range engagements.",
